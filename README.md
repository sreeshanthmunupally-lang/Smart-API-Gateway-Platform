# Smart API Gateway Platform


---

> A portable personal AI gateway: multi-provider routing, five-protocol conversion, smart failover, and one place to manage AI services.

API Switch is a local-first AI API management and forwarding hub. It gives your tools one local endpoint while managing multiple upstream providers and protocols, including OpenAI-compatible APIs, OpenAI Responses, Claude, Gemini, and Azure OpenAI.

> Scope note: API Switch is designed as a personal local tool. It trusts the local machine by default and is not a public multi-tenant security boundary. If you expose it to the internet, add your own reverse proxy, TLS, authentication, and access controls.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Unified proxy endpoint | Point clients to one local OpenAI-compatible endpoint and route requests to many upstream providers. |
| Five protocol families | OpenAI-compatible, OpenAI Responses, Claude Messages, Gemini, and Azure OpenAI adapters. |
| Model pool and group routing | Manual models, aliases, groups, exact match, fuzzy match, and AUTO fallback. |
| Smart ordering | Custom order, fastest-first, newest-first, speed tests, and recommendation scores. |
| Three-layer resilience | Persistent model cooldown, in-memory circuit breaker, and channel-level freeze. |
| Empty-stream protection | Treats HTTP 200 streams with no valid output as failures instead of letting clients wait forever. |
| Logs and dashboard | Request volume, success rate, token usage, model distribution, failure path, and redacted diagnostics. |
| Shared Desktop / Web Admin UI | One React codebase for the Tauri desktop app and browser-based Web Admin. |
| Headless mode | Run only the backend proxy and admin services on a server, NAS, or remote host. |
| App connectors | Generate or write configuration for tools such as OpenCode CLI, Codex CLI, Claude Code, and Zed. |

## Supported Protocols and Upstreams

| Type | Authentication | Typical behavior |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| OpenAI-compatible | Bearer Token | `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models` |
| OpenAI Responses | Bearer Token | `/v1/responses` compatibility layer with text, function tools, streaming, and Chat fallback |
| Claude Messages | `x-api-key` | Main-path conversion between Claude Messages and OpenAI Chat |
| Gemini | query `key` / OpenAI-compatible paths | Gemini OpenAI-compatible endpoint and selected native endpoints |
| Azure OpenAI | `api-key` header | Deployment-name-based routing and upstream request construction |
| Custom | Bearer Token | Third-party OpenAI-compatible services and relay providers |

Note: the current implementation still uses OpenAI Chat Completions as the primary internal compatibility layer. For advanced Responses, Claude, and Gemini semantics, API Switch narrows output through protocol-specific allowlists to avoid leaking unsupported fields.

## Runtime Modes

### Desktop

The Tauri v2 desktop app includes:

- React management UI
- Local proxy server
- Tauri IPC commands
- System tray
- Local window and settings management

### Web Admin

Web Admin uses the same React pages through HTTP Admin APIs:

- Browser-based management UI
- Bearer-token login and authentication
- Shared channel, model-pool, token, log, and settings management

### Headless / Server-only

For environments without a GUI, start only the backend services:

```bash
api-switch --headless
# or
API_SWITCH_HEADLESS=1 api-switch
```

This is useful for servers, NAS devices, remote machines, or any setup that only needs the proxy and admin services.

### Android / Mobile

Android is treated as another build shell / compile branch of the same product, not a separate product line. The direction is to reuse the shared core and responsive UI. Real-device proxy listening, WebView lifecycle, loopback/cleartext behavior, and client integration are still future verification areas.

---

## Quick Start

### Download and Run

1. Download a build from [Releases](https://github.com/wang1970/API-Switch/releases).
2. Start API Switch.
3. Add upstream API Base URLs and API keys in **Channels**.
4. Fetch models, or manually add models in **API Management**.
5. Point your client to the local API Switch proxy endpoint.

### Client Configuration

Default proxy port: `9090`.

```text
API Base URL: http://127.0.0.1:9090
API Key: any value; if Access Key enforcement is enabled, use a client token created in API Switch
Model: auto, a concrete model name, or a group name
```

Common routing inputs:

| Model value | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `auto` | Selects from enabled, non-cooled entries in the AUTO group. |
| Concrete model name | Prefers exact match, then fuzzy/group matching and AUTO fallback according to routing rules. |
| Group name | Maps several upstream models behind one stable client-facing name. |

## Routing and Resilience

Main request path:

```text
Client / AI Tool
  -> API Switch Proxy Endpoint
  -> protocol parser / compatibility layer
  -> router / failover / cooldown
  -> upstream provider
  -> response converter / stream relay
  -> usage log / dashboard stats
```

Resilience layers:

- **L1 DB cooldown (model-level)**: failed entries are cooled down in SQLite and remain cooled after restart.
- **L2 in-memory circuit breaker (model + channel)**: repeated failures open a short-lived breaker with half-open recovery probes.
- **L3 channel freeze (channel-level)**: account quota, key, or upstream channel failures can temporarily remove the whole channel from routing.
- **Status-code disable**: unrecoverable statuses such as 401 / 403 / 410 can disable the affected entry.
- **Streaming empty-output detection**: long-running SSE streams with no valid output trigger failure handling.
- **Traceable logs**: failure logs include attempt paths to show which candidates and conversion steps were tried.

## Management UI

Main pages:

- Dashboard: request count, success rate, token usage, model distribution, trend charts.
- Channels: upstream channels, URL probing, model fetching, protocol detection.
- API Management: model pool, groups, ordering, aliases, enabled state.
- Tokens: client Access Keys.
- Logs: pagination, filters, expanded details, failure diagnostics.
- Settings: ports, authentication, cooldown, theme, language, Web Admin.
- App Connectors: generate or write configuration for common AI tools.

---

## Local Development

Requirements:

- Node.js / pnpm
- Rust 1.85+
- Tauri v2 prerequisites

Common commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # build Web Admin, then start desktop dev mode
pnpm build            # desktop build
pnpm build:web-admin  # build Web Admin frontend
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript type check
```

Android commands are kept for the mobile build branch:

```bash
pnpm android:init
pnpm android:dev
pnpm android:build
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Desktop | Tauri v2 |
| Backend | Rust, axum, reqwest |
| Database | SQLite / rusqlite, WAL mode |
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript, Vite |
| UI | Radix UI, Tailwind CSS v4 |
| State | TanStack React Query |
| Charts | Recharts |
| i18n | i18next / react-i18next |

## Data and Security

- Data is stored locally in SQLite.
- Upstream API keys and client Access Keys are separated.
- Web Admin uses login plus Bearer Token authentication.
- Logs redact sensitive values before display.
- This project is not a public multi-tenant gateway; harden it yourself before public exposure.

## Documentation

- [Usage Guide](GUIDE.md)
- [Technical Whitepaper](WHITEPAPER.md)

## Project Status

API Switch is actively evolving for personal local use. Planned work includes a neutral internal representation, capability-based routing, more native Gemini endpoints, better preservation of advanced Responses / Claude / Gemini semantics, and Web Admin completion work.
